# Gain Insights About Your CSS

CSS Stats is a **free and open source** tool that's used by many companies and
projects. It's intended to help CSS authors debug issues and generate
documentation for a site.

## How does it work?

CSS Stats analyzes a web page and finds all stylesheets (linked or embedded)
and combines them. The resulting CSS is then analyzed and returned. The CSS
Stats dashboard turns the data into digestible bits of information. You can
also use the [API endpoints](/docs/api) to use the raw data in custom apps
or dashboards.
